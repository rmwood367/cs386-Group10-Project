## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Appreciate Brian Dorame for creating the attributes and classes for the UML diagram to start off discussiion about it
2. Successes: Our team were able to have a successful meeting with everyone present and be a day earlier than previous meetings
3. Failures: UML Diagram was finished past the expected deadline by Friday. Some classes and attributes were changed last minute.
4. Barriers: Our team was planning how to have everyone contribute, aware of the upcoming warnings concerning with GitHub Issues, Pull Request, usage of Issues.
