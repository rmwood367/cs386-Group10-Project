### Final Value Proposition and Consumer Segments:
It seems that the value of the application does exist and that there is an audience of consumers with interest. It also appears that the audience is small enough that we can appeal to a small group of people easier. While there is evidence of some people not being interested it seemes like we will be able to focus on our community and make a great application for them.
